#Custom tools to modify website at compile time.

##Brief description of main tools

###Getting the new format for metadata

1. use `olympiadCsv2Json.py` to convert old metadata format, from *csv* to *json*.
2. use `modernize.py` to enhance the *json* returned by `olympiadCsv2Json.py`
with more metadata, used by the build system.

Note that the rationale behind the new *json* format, is that it is more
expressive than plain old *csv*, and it is suitable for both, compile time
templating/formating, as well as runtime templating. So in a future,
it could be possible to rewrite the site as a responsive web application.

###Preprocessing

The end site is generated by *jekyll*, however, generating the markdown
required is a repetitive task, given the data centric nature of the site.

Before jekyll applying *liquid* tags, we preproccess the site with mustache,
reading *json* metadata and a markdown template.

See `mustachify` to check how this step is done.
